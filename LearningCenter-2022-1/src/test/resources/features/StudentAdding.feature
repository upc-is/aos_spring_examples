Feature: Student Adding
  As a Developer
  I want to add Student through API
  So that It can be available to applications.

  Background:
    Given The Endpoint "http://localhost:%d/api/v1/students" is available

    @student-adding
    Scenario: Add Student
    When A Post Request is sent with values "John Doe", 35, "Anywhere"
    Then A Response is received with Status 200
    And An Student Resource is included in Response Body, with values "John Doe", 35, "Anywhere"

    @student-duplicated
    Scenario: Add Student with existing Name
      Given An Student Resource with values "Jason Bourne", 42, "Secret Place" is already stored
      When A Post Request is sent with values "Jason Bourne", 42, "Secret Place"
      Then A Response is received with Status 400
      And A Message is included in Response Body, with value "Not all constraints satisfied for Student: An student with the same name already exists."
